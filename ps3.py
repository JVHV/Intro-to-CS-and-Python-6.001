    lowercase letters, so you will have to handle uppercase and mixed case strings 
    appropriately. 

	The score for a word is the product of two components:

	The first component is the sum of the points for letters in the word.
	The second component is the larger of:

	worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on.
